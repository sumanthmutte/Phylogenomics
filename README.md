All the data and scripts concerning phylogenetic tree construction from OneKP and MMETSP datasets ara availbale in this repository. 
The method has been developed and tested earlier with few gene families in auxin pathway:

A detailed version of the protocol will be available soon. 

InterproscanSummary.py takes in the tsv format from InterProScan results.
